This document is also available in [spanish](README.md) or [catalan](README_cat.md).

## What is this 
CTTL es a project made by the Tecnología Cívica y Empoderamientos professorship at the Universitat Politècnica de Valencia, an association which seeks  the compilation, review and documentation of civic tools which help the citizenship empowerment by solving open government issues. For this purpose this document will be a showcase of tools which fulfill the above requirements. For each one of the tools we'll explain how to install and deploy it and also we'll provide a docker image with it already installed for inmediate testing. All documented tools are bond to a free, open source or public domain license wich allow acces, modification and redistribution of code to any person or entity.
